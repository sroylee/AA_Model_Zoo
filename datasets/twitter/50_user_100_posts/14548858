REF hey how are you?  Taking it easy? (oxymoron not? )	14548858

REF coming home is always much harder than going. :)	14548858

REF Wow, Happy Birthday to him!  :)	14548858
REF thanks.   It was taken on St Patrick's Day last year. : )	14548858
REF lol, it's like eating a meal cooked by someone other than  yourself - isn't it?	14548858
REF that was a whole other experience.  One of the most interesting places I've ever been to.  Worked on a Moshav.  LOVED it!!	14548858
blood results back in.  Infection of some sort (could this be the surgeon's doing?) and my thyroid is really low.  That explains alot.	14548858
REF oh you and I think alike.  I wanted to know what other parents were thinking, not get lectured to.  But it happens every time	14548858
REF Starbucks might be another resource. :)	14548858
REF I have to go for another ultrasound on Mon.  It's been two months now and the pain is worse.  I'm wondering infection?	14548858
Apparently, my kids are getting hungry.  Which means I need to leave you all : )	14548858

Finally back from the cab driving day and got rid of two of the little boys.  Can I say HEADACHE? lol!	14548858
REF I grill when I can, until the snow appears on the ground.  It's so much less mess inside and we can eat on the deck.	14548858
REF they came back this am.  As usual, an adjustment period, but M was off at Girl Scouts rehearsal this pm, so PEACE! LOL	14548858

REF It's that "judgy crowd" again.  They have nothing better to do.  She's perfect the way she is.  I'll beat them up for you.	14548858
REF and my husband's latest excuse : She's getting old and senile.  This woman is way too evil to be senile, sheesh! :(	14548858
REF I have, LOL - normally a very organised traveler, but I'm in excruciating pain today from endometriosis and it's thrown me of	14548858

REF she's eleven, but not in size, LOL\	14548858
And from my own experience, "adultery" in VA can mean that you can file for an "at fault" divorce.  I need to look through my notes.	14548858
REF which one?  How are you?  Did you ever get to the doctor?  Been thinking about you. :)	14548858
REF oh yes, you are very wise to give it up now before it becomes a problem.  Like my son and his pacifier!	14548858
REF no failure here.  You are an amazing mother.  It happens.  They're kids and they move too fast. *hugs* xoxoxox	14548858

REF oh noooo!  That is never a good thing when they nap like that. :(  I hope it's nothing serious!	14548858
REF you're not the only one.  Several other people had it happen to them too. :(	14548858
REF yes they have, but I think they're a little homesick.  My Mom has been hard on Brian because he eats nothing.	14548858
REF well, that sounds just like my daughter and the kind of thing she would say.  She is challenging right? LOL! :)	14548858
and he got battleax back for the time she wouldn't listen to him - she didn't listen to him this time either and he threw up.  So there.	14548858

REF oh no! That is the worst! sorry. : (	14548858
REF but with the weather and roads, I don't think I'm taking that chance.  She'll be fine I'm sure.	14548858
REF I wish I'd had one of those when I was training.  Where can  you get them?	14548858
REF *sigh* I know.  I'd rather be anywhere but there on a Friday night.  But, he LOVES it.  It's his birthday wish.	14548858
REF I feel for you.  I am usually really healthy, but since the move I haven't had the focus or time.  It will get better. :)	14548858
REF wait till they get to eleven.  I'm putting together a collage of my girl's elementary school years and it's flown by!	14548858
I would kill for coffee. Well, not really. Just sayin'	14548858
REF yes, I definitely have an accent. (according to you Americans). South African/Irish/English. (Lived in London for NUM years)	14548858

REF crap.  do you have allergies?	14548858
REF omg, that smile is heart-melting!	14548858

REF you're so good to me. *muwah* xx	14548858

REF I know, mine haven't even asked yet because they know he comes after Thanksgiving - it's crazy!	14548858

REF you're making me want to come in live in CA.  It reminds me so much of SA!	14548858

REF so sorry.  Just glad you are OK.  Are you able to practice at all?	14548858
